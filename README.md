# A-GAM-Study-on-the-OneStop-L2-Corpus
we ask whether second-language (L2) readers are more sensitive to lexical surprisal than native (L1) readers. Using the OneStop Eye Movements} datasets Ordinary Reading for L1 OneStopL2 for L2 ,we compute word-by-word surprisal from Pythia-70M with streaming left-to-right inference and fit GAM for FFD,FRD,TFD, controlling length and log frequency.
